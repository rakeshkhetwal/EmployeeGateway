How to run code :
1. Activate the virtual server named virtualenv.
2. Then bang the code python manage.py runserver.
3. That's it, cheers you did it.


IDEA:
1. A simplistic software platform has been developed, which will help MSME sector to have single unique identification numbers which will
contain all information of employees working in different departments.This app will also be capable to sovling one of the main problems in this
sector and allow the caretakers to make 1 click payments of salary(ESI, PF & Pension acounts) and at the same ime will maintain ledger for
individual payment accounts i.e. ESI, PF & Pension.
2. Employee identification number generation will be random and unique like Adhaar Number. It will contain all the information that is required
for it to be capable enough for making salary payment under different account at once.
3. Our system will have a 8-digit employee identification number. 7-digits are generated using the Venhoeffâ€™s Algorithm and the 8th digit is the
check sum.
4. Details that the employee identification number will contain for each employee :-
I. ESI
II. Provident Fund
III. Pension
IV. Name of the Employee
V. Department
VI. ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT IS REQUIRED
5. A single cheque can be issued for making salary payments for all the different accounts of an employee althrough with the employee
identification number.

Technology stack:
1. Operating system used for development : Linux
2. PyQt
3. Cordova/PhoneGap
4. Backend : Django
5. Frontend : HTML, CSS3, Javascript.
6. Database : MySQL

Show stoppers:
1. Generation of random and unique employee
identification number.
2. All salary payment account details for any employee can be
accessed using a single employee identification number.
3. Seperate accounts for ESI, PF & Pension accounts are maintained.

Future Possibilities:
1. One click payments all under the supervision of caretakers.
2. QR code generation for employee identification numbers which can be used to get details of employee under different departments.
